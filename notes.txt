Render pages:

    Call special component type that has some identifier to make
    it link to the database provided


Take tables UserAccounts and UserCodes

UserAccounts:
first_name, surname, full_name, email, password_hash


UserCodes:
email, code

```

<div class="component-main {additional-classes}" {custom-id} {custom-style}>
    <h1>
        <!-- name -->
    </h1>
</div>


```

let @ dictate SQL

Might need some way to prepare values in a batch later down the line instead of doing
single calls each time, but good for a proof of concept

```

component(
    name: "main",
    values: ["name"=>"@table='UserAccounts'&field='first_name'"]
)

```
